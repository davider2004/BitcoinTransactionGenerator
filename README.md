# How can I do?
To start we must configure it. So download Atom.io and open the file "index.js". In the first line you can find the configurations. in "addrReceiver" the receiver address, then type the bitcoin amount in the "bitcoinAmount" section, then type the sender address in "customSender", or leave it blank to generate it instantly. Here is an example:
<br><br>
// ------ CONFIGURE BOX ------------<br>
var addrReceiver = '1zrk2yqbegUjvTUSLdkfhfHwLcqhCovxQ'; // Type the receiver address!!!!<br>
var bitcoinAmount = '1000000000'; // ex: you want 0.5 BTC, you must type 500000000 (base: 0000000000). For help contact me on Github.<br>
var customSender = ''; // If you want to customize the sender address, please type it here or leave it blank for random generation<br>
